# Enchanted dyes

This minecraft datapack allows you to enchant items using dyes. A full list of which dyes are for which enchantments are below. To enchant the item simply put it in a crafting grid with the correct dyes. To increase the level of the enchantment you must add another of the same dye into another slot of the crafting grid. To make sure that this isn't too OP you must combine enchantments on an anvil rather than just crafting them on.

## For creators
If you are a creator and would like to use this for a video all you have to do is credit me in the description and link to the repo. I would also appreciate it if you could send me a link to the video.

## Installation instructions

**Please note this only works if you are on minecraft Java edition, I have no plans of making a bedrock port.**

Create a minecraft world and then go into the world folder. You should find a folder here called datapacks. Then from inside the folder run the following command:
```git clone https://github.com/EmeraldThunder1/enchanted-dyes```

Alternatively, if you do not have git installed you can download the repo and manually paste it into your datapacks folder.
